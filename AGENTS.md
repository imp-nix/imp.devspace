- This is a multi-repo workspace (no root git repo).
- Remember to `git add` untracked files before doing nix evals.
- If developing a working version of a library or dependency, and needing to test changes from the consuming flake, use the `--override-input` arg in nix evals, e.g. `--override-input nixdoc path:.imp.docgen/`. Do not change the input url/path directly in the consumer.
- Local dev references are in `tmp/` (gitignored); should not be linked to/referenced by committed code.
- If writing documentation, see the [style guide](./docs/documentation-style/guide.md).
